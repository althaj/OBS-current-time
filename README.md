## Setup
In OBS add a Browser source. In the properties of this source fill the following:
- URL: https://althaj.github.io/OBS-current-time/
- Width: 152
- Height: 32
- Refresh browser when scene becomes active: true

## Customize
If you want to customize the clock you can use my query builder: https://althaj.github.io/OBS-current-time/query-builder
It provides you with an URL that you paste into the URL field in the Browser source in OBS.

That's it. More settings to come later.
